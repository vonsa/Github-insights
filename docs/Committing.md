# Committing to the project

When committing to the project, a set of automated pre-commit checks are executed to validate the commit. They are done locally using pre-commit hooks as well as remotely using Azure DevOps pipeline scripts.

### Checks

- ESLint
- svelte-check
- Prettier
- TypeScript
- Jest

### Beneficial extensions

- ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- prettier (esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- Jest (orta.vscode-jest)
